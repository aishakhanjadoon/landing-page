Whispers of Anatolia | A Turkish Culinary Journey
Project Overview
Welcome to "Whispers of Anatolia," a captivating and immersive landing page designed to transport visitors to the heart of Turkish culinary traditions. This project is a personal endeavor, serving as a dynamic showcase of my front-end development skills, particularly in CSS and JavaScript.

Inspired by the whimsical and heartfelt aesthetic of Studio Ghibli, this landing page aims to provide a serene yet interactive user experience. It features a custom cursor, subtle animations, and a responsive design, all crafted to evoke a sense of warmth, nostalgia, and discovery.

Features
Ghibli-Inspired Design: A soft, muted color palette and gentle typography create a welcoming atmosphere reminiscent of Ghibli films.
Custom Cursor: An interactive custom cursor enhances the user experience and adds a unique touch.
Star Trail Animation: A mesmerizing star trail follows the main cursor, adding a magical, ethereal effect.
Hero Section Parallax: A subtle parallax effect on the hero image creates depth and responsiveness to mouse movement.
Scroll-Triggered Animations: Elements fade in and slide up gracefully as the user scrolls, improving engagement and visual flow using IntersectionObserver.
Dynamic Menu Filtering: Users can filter menu items by category (e.g., Dawn Bites, Midday Feasts, Twilight Delights) using JavaScript.
Smooth Scrolling Navigation: Seamless transitions between sections for an enhanced user journey.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Basic Form Handling: A simple contact form demonstration with client-side feedback.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure and semantic content.
CSS3: Styling, animations, and responsive design, heavily utilizing custom properties (CSS variables).
JavaScript (ES6+): Interactive elements, DOM manipulation, animations (including custom cursor, star trail, and scroll reveals), and menu filtering logic.
Purpose & Learning Outcomes
This project was developed to:

Demonstrate advanced CSS capabilities: Including custom properties, complex transitions, keyframe animations, and responsive layouts (Flexbox, Grid).
Showcase practical JavaScript application: Highlighting skills in DOM manipulation, event listeners, dynamic content updates, and API-like interactions (e.g., IntersectionObserver).
Build a polished portfolio piece: Illustrating my ability to create visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly web interfaces from concept to execution.
Explore creative design implementation: Translating a specific aesthetic (Ghibli) into a functional web design.
